// Create a full production-ready application for a To-Do app using React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Express.js. 
// Follow best practices for both frontend and backend development. The application should include the following requirements:

// =================== BACKEND ===================
// 1. Use Node.js and Express.js to create the backend.
// 2. Create a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
//    - `POST /api/todos` to create a new to-do.
//    - `GET /api/todos` to retrieve all to-dos.
//    - `PATCH /api/todos/:id` to update a to-do (mark as completed or edit the title).
//    - `DELETE /api/todos/:id` to delete a to-do.
// 3. Use a MongoDB database to store to-do items. Each to-do should have the following fields:
//    - `id`: Unique identifier for the to-do.
//    - `title`: Title of the to-do (string).
//    - `completed`: Boolean to mark the to-do as completed (default: false).
//    - `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the to-do was created.
// 4. Validate inputs using a library like `Joi` to ensure data integrity.
// 5. Use `dotenv` for environment variables. Include placeholders for:
//    - `PORT` (default: 5000)
//    - `MONGO_URI` (MongoDB connection string).
// 6. Implement CORS to allow communication with the frontend.
// 7. Ensure proper error handling with consistent response structures for errors (e.g., status code, error message).
// 8. Include middleware for logging requests in development mode.

// =================== FRONTEND ===================
// 1. Use React.js to build the frontend.
// 2. Style the application using Tailwind CSS with a responsive design.
// 3. Create the following components:
//    - **TodoList**: Displays a list of to-dos with an option to mark them as completed or delete them.
//    - **AddTodo**: A form to add a new to-do.
//    - **EditTodo**: A modal or inline editor to update an existing to-do's title.
// 4. Fetch to-do data from the backend using `axios` or `fetch`.
// 5. Show loading states and error messages during API requests.
// 6. Use React Context or a state management library (like Redux) to manage the application state.
// 7. Implement dark mode support using Tailwind CSS.
// 8. Include proper folder structure for components, services (API requests), and styles.
// 9. Use `.env` files for frontend configurations such as `REACT_APP_API_URL`.

// =================== DEPLOYMENT ===================
// 1. Write a `Dockerfile` for both the frontend and backend for containerization.
// 2. Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up the services (frontend, backend, database) locally and in production.
// 3. Add scripts in `package.json` for production builds and starting the application.
// 4. Write a `README.md` explaining how to set up and run the application locally and in production.
// 5. Add environment variable examples in `.env.example` files for both frontend and backend.

// Ensure the application follows security best practices:
// - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
// - Use HTTPS for secure communication in production.
// - Handle sensitive data securely in `.env` files and never expose secrets in the repository.

// Include comments in the code explaining key sections and functions.
